# ElevatorSimulator
**Final project for CMSC182**

This is a simple program that acts as a kind of elevator logic
control with basic functionality. The elevator goes to every floor
and allows up to 5 people to get on iff they are going in the same
direction as the elevator.

## Planned Features
  * Allow requests to be made to the elevator controller by people
  * Have the elevator find an efficient path to transport passengers
  
## Known problems
  * ~~Sometimes passengers decide to get off the elevator twice without getting on twice~~
